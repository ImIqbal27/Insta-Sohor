        <h2>Q<sub>1</sub> : How does Javascript work ?</h2>
        <p>Answer: JavaScript is a Client-side Scripting Language.This programming language runs inside an browser .
            After loading the page, the browser has a built-in interpreter that reads the JavaScript code if it in the
            page and execute it.Front end developer / designers use JavaScript in many different ways. JavaScript’s
            syntax is heavily inspired by C++ and Java. JavaScript is an interpreted language which means the JavaScript
            engine(V8) converts the Js code line by line and runs in the same manner instead of converting the whole
            program once. <br>
            Javascript execution in V8 is divided into three(3) stages: <br>

            #1 : Source To Syntax Tree <br>

            #2 : Syntax Tree To Bytecode <br>

            #3 : Bytecode To Machine Code</p> <br>


        <h2>Q<sub>2</sub>: What does Javascript event loop do ?</h2>

        <p>Answer: The Event Loop is the system that JavaScript uses in the browser to handle the execution of multiple
            pieces of code. It consists of the Call Stack, Web APIs, and the Callback Queue. It is responsible for
            giving JavaScript its asynchronous programming ability.
            JavaScript is a single-threaded, asynchronous language with a concurrency model that is based on a `run to
            completion` event loop. <br>

            <b>Single-Threaded:</b> JavaScript is a single-threaded language, that means it can
            only
            'process' one command at a time, from top to bottom. <br>

            <b> Asynchronous:</b> The browser
            and its Web APIs are what give JavaScript its asynchronous powers; the language by itself actually doesnt
            have this capability. <br>

            <b> Call Stack:</b> This is the stack where the code is executed one step
            at a time. JavaScript functions are added to the stack in a LIFO order.
            There is only one Call Stack in JS, that makes it single-threaded. <br>

            <b>Web APIs:</b> These asynchronous calls are provided by the browser to give additional functionality to
            the
            JS engine. After a Web API is pushed onto the Call Stack, it is then sent to a separate Web API
            container and once an action is triggered the callback function is added to the Callback Queue. <br>

            <b>Callback Queue:</b> This is a queue data structure that adds the callback functions from the Web APIs in
            a FIFO
            order. After the Call Stack is through running all of the synchronous JavaScript, the
            Callback Queue is dequeued onto the Call Stack one function at a time and then executed. <br>

        </p>






        <h2>Q<sub>3</sub> : Difference between Local Storage and Session Storage ?</h2>
        <p>Answer: Local Storage and Session Storage are more similar than different. Most modern browsers should
            support Local Storage and Session Storage features. They are used to store data in the browser. They are
            accessible from the client-side only . Also since they are a
            front-end tool, they have no SSL support.Each browser has a different specifications on how much data can be
            stored inside Local and Session Storage.</p>

        <h4>Local Storage</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Expire never</li>
            <li>Client side only</li>
            <li>Accessible from any Window</li>
            <li>No SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) support</li>
            <li>Data are not transferred on each HTTP request</li>
            <li>5 mb limit</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Session Storage</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Expire on tab close </li>
            <li>Client side only</li>
            <li>Accessible from same tab</li>
            <li>No SSL(Secure Sockets Layer) support</li>
            <li>Data are not transferred on each HTTP request</li>
            <li>5/10 mb limit</li>
        </ul>
